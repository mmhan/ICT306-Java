Question 2: 
2.1) find all lines in a big text file that do not have capital letter A in them
    grep -v "A" bigtext.txt

--
2.2) ditto, but do have capital B as well as no capital As (do this in two wasy: via one regular expression and via a pipeline of several greps)

    grep -v "A" bigtext.txt | grep "B"

Based on look ahead and look behind negation, the command I execute is

    grep -e (?!A)B(?!A) bigtext.txt

However, due to shell's way of handling exclamation marks the regexp didn't acieve the purpose.
